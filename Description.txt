Solution:

First create a class of SmartString where we have a vector<char> where string is stored as char vector.
Then we have append() method which converts incoming string to char and pushback to vector. this can be used to append and 
store string.

the we have getcharat() which takes integer input to get char from vector, also checking index is with in limit.

In length() it return the length of vector which is actually the length of string.
